        <p>The health of <span id="pet_attribute_name"></span> is <span id="pet_attribute_health">100</span>. If health reaches zero, your pet dies, and that's not good for staying in the game. Your pet will regain health if you keep hunger, sleepiness and boredom at 75% or lower. Your pet will start to loose health if those max out.</p>
        <p>The hunger of <span id="pet_attribute_name"></span> is <span id="pet_attribute_hunger">5</span>.</p>
        <p>The sleepiness of <span id="pet_attribute_name"></span> is <span id="pet_attribute_sleepiness">5</span>.</p>
        <p>The boredom of <span id="pet_attribute_name"></span> is <span id="pet_attribute_boredom">5</span>.</p>
        <p>Hunger, sleepiness and boredom increase until they get to 20, at which point they stay there, ticking away your health.</p>
        <p>The will of <span id="pet_attribute_name"></span> is <span id="pet_attribute_will">5</span>. Will has impact on various gameplay aspects. It decreases very slowly, and some activities will increase it.</p>
        <p><span id="pet_attribute_name"></span> has $<span id="pet_attribute_money"></span> in their bank account.</p>
        <p>The age of <span id="pet_attribute_name"></span> is <span id="pet_attribute_age">0</span>. It is just a number, but if it reaches 100, your pet dies. We all gotta go someday, or do we?</p>
